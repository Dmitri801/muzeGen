- when image uploads, set background image mode to cover if its not already
- background image should go over the gradient background on main canvas
- when drawing, check for opacity and whether or not pattern is selected
- when search gets clicked from background, - unsplash add to canvas button should know its a background , and url should be added to the background image state
- listen for opacity changes - redraw image and gradient
